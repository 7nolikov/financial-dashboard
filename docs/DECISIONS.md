# Decisions (ADR-style, concise)

- Use Vite + React + TS for fast dev experience and build.
- Use Visx for performance with potential canvas path and decimation.
- Prefer Zustand over Redux for simpler local-first state.
- Use Local Storage with versioned migrations for persistence.
- Separate inflation handling with real/nominal toggle and import capability.
